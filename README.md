# Handwritten Digit Recognizer

Still a work in progress getting it ready for publication but this will contain the DNN for recognizing handwritten digits that I made as a Freshman in college.

Uses python and numpy for the DNN. Uses cv2 for some simple image manipulation and user inputted handwritten numbers.

Files should be uploaded shortly!
